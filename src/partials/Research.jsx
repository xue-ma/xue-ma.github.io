        My master thesis (Ma 2020) is an ethnography of a group of microfinance workers in China. I
        follow their everyday work routines in order to understand their “intermediary” positions in
        the global chain of financialization and development. You can check out my thesis here

        My current dissertation research is about the digital money landscape in China. This project
        investigates the dynamics among state, market and society in the emergence of digital monies
        in China.
