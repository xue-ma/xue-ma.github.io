        As an international student in Canada, being a Teaching Assistant is both a means of making
        a living and a pedagogical training trajectory for professional development in academia.
        However, teaching is a totally new skill that is not taught and even though we all know so
        well how to learn, teaching is still a mystery and needs a lot of decolonization.
        Particularly, teaching and researching as a non-native English speaker is a path with both
        challenges and rewards. And there seems to be more challenges in the early stage (especially
        entering a new country and entering a new role at the same time).
